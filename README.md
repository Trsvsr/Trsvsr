<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Trevor! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<b>Who am I?</b>

- I'm a fourth-year computer science student at Wichita State. 
- I like programming, being most proficient at iOS and macOS platform development using Objective-C.
  - I also have experience with C(++) and Python (notably the Django framework).
  - I also have a little bit of experience with C#, Java, and PHP.
  

<b>Some notable projects I've been involved with:</b>

- <b>[iDeviceReRestore](https://downgrade.party)</b>: a tool (based on [libimobiledevice's idevicerestore](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/idevicerestore)) that exploits a flaw in iOS 9.x iBoot on 32-bit iOS devices that allows going from any iOS version to iOS 9.x provided that the proper tickets have been saved beforehand.
- <b>[CoolBooter](https://coolbooter.com)</b>: a dual-booting tool for 32-bit (and soon 64-bit) iOS devices by utilizing winocm's ios-kexec-utils.

<b>What do I have on here?</b>

- Most of the repositories I have on here consist of old Theos projects from when I fiddled with jailbroken iOS development.
  - GitHub should have the language for those respositories listed as Logos.
  - They're only here for archival purposes and any updates should not be expected for any of those repositories.
- Pretty much anything else is a personal project that may or may not serve some use outside of my own workflow.

I think that's about it for now, thanks for reading!
