<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Trevor! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<b>Who am I?</b>

- I'm a third-year computer science student at Wichita State. 
- I like programming, being most proficient at iOS and macOS platform development using Objective-C.
  - I also often program in C++, Python (with the Django framework), and Java.
  - I do have some experience with SQL database management.
  

<b>Some notable projects I've been involved with:</b>

- <b>[iDeviceReRestore](https://downgrade.party)</b>: a tool (based on [libimobiledevice's idevicerestore](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/idevicerestore)) that exploits a flaw in iOS 9.x iBoot on 32-bit iOS devices that allows going from any iOS version to iOS 9.x provided that the proper tickets have been saved beforehand.
- <b>[CoolBooter](https://coolbooter.com)</b>: a dual-booting tool for 32-bit (and soon 64-bit) iOS devices by utilizing winocm's ios-kexec-utils.

<b>What else is on here?</b>

- Most of the repositories I have on here consist of old Theos projects from when I fiddled with jailbroken iOS development. They're only here for archival purposes and any updates should not be expected for any of these repositories.
- Eventually I'll upload some more personal projects, but I want to make their code less ugly first.

I think that's about it for now, thanks for reading!
